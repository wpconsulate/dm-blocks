Content blocks for global content, with revisions. Use HTML without formatting being broken. Not only for devs.

== Description ==

Not only for developers.
Create content blocks for reusable global content. Supports revisions. With input fields for raw HTML, JS, and CSS without worrying about auto formatting, with an option to also use the usual formatted Wordpress tinyMCE editor.

This plugin let's you create modular content blocks the right way:

1. Content blocks are a post type.
2. Allows you to add HTML, CSS, and JS in separate blocks using ACE editor with code completion and error notifications.
3. Wordpress WYSIWYG editor optional.
4. Revisions(!) You can change your Wordpress content, HTML, CSS, and JS and then go back to a previous state the same as you can with the out of the box wordpress post revisions.
5. Use a shortcode to add the blocks in posts, pages, CPT's, widgets, and in your theme files.
6. Preview your content.
7. Easily import & export using the default Wordpress XML import/export tool.
